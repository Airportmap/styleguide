# Airportmap Style Guide

This is the official style guide for the Airportmap project. It contains the official and original logos, wordmark and color schemes used by the Airportmap website and related services and products.

You are welcome to use these logos and the word mark to refer to Airportmap or its services—they are free to use as long as you make reference to Airportmap and its developer [@komed3](https://github.com/komed3).

## Logo

The Airportmap logo features a simple and modern design that aims to visually reflect the themes of aviation and navigation.

The focal point is a stylized “A” framed by a circular gradient in shades of green. This symbol is emblematic of the name “A”irportmap and at the same time attempts to imitate the shape of an airplane.

The logo uses a smooth and fresh color gradient in various shades of green and cyan. For use as an icon, in small sizes or as an additional favicon, a simplified SVG version is provided, which completely avoids colors and consists of a single path. The logo itself is available in standard sizes in PNG format, as a high-res version and as an SVG as well.

## Wordmark

The very simple wordmark follows the design rules of the logo and uses the same colors in the same gradient.

The wordmark uses REM as its font—the main font of the project and used by the website—and depicts the name of the project. It is available in various sizes in PNG format and as an SVG version also.
